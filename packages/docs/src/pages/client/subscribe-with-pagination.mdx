# subscribeWithPagination

`subscribeWithPagination` is a special type of subscription that is used to fetch data in pages. It is similar to `subscribe` but it has a few differences:

- It expects the query to have a `limit` defined.
- It returns `nextPage` and `prevPage` functions to fetch the next and previous pages of data.
- The subscription callback will have `hasNextPage` and `hasPreviousPage` booleans to indicate if there are more pages to fetch.

```typescript
const { unsubscribe, nextPage, prevPage } = client.subscribeWithPagination(
  query,
  (results, { hasRemoteFulfilled, hasNextPage, hasPreviousPage }) => {
    // handle results
  },
  (error) => {
    // handle error
  },
  // Optional
  {
    localOnly: false,
    onRemoteFulfilled: () => {
      console.log('server has sent back results for the subscription');
    },
  }
);
```
