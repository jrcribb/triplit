# Client configuration

## DB options

These options define your local cache.

- `schema` is a hard coded schema for your local cache
- `storage` determines the storage engines for your local cache (see [Storage](/client/storage))

## Sync options

These options define how you want to sync with the server.

- `serverUrl` is the url of the server where your project lives e.g. `https://<project-id>.triplit.io`
- `autoConnect` determines whether the client should connect to the server immediately upon instantiation. If set to `false`, you can manually connect with the `client.connect()` method.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The client connects over
  [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API),
  so you if you are instantiating a client in code that may run in an
  environment where WebSockets are not available (e.g. the server during
  server-side rendering), you should set `autoConnect` to `false` or preferably
  to an [environmental
  variable](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$app-environment-browser) that
  indicates whether the client should connect.
</Callout>

The `serverUrl` can be updated with the `client.updateServerUrl` method.

## Auth options

These options define how you authenticate with your client database and remote database.

- `token` is a jwt that is used to identify the user to the client database and remote databases (see the [Auth guide](/auth)). Providing a `token` will set the variable `$session.SESSION_USER_ID` on the database, which is used for authorization rules.
- `claimsPath` is the path to the Triplit claims on the token. It should be a `.` separated string like `path.to.claims`. This should match the value set on your project in the Triplit Dashboard.

The `token` can be updated with the `client.updateToken` method.

Use the `client.updateOptions` method if you need to update the `serverUrl` and `token` atomically.

It is recommended that your client is disconnected before calling `client.updateOptions`, `client.updateServerUrl` or `client.updateOptions`. If the connection is open, the client will disconnect automatically and you will need to call `client.connect()` again to reconnect.

For best practices on using these APIs and updating user sessions, see the [Auth guide](/auth#changing-users).
