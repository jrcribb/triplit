# Limit

Many times you will want to limit the number of results returned by a query. To do this, you can use the `Limit` method.

For example, the following query will return the 10 most recently created users.

```typescript
const query = client
  .query('users')
  .Select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob'])
  .Order('created_at', 'DESC')
  .Limit(10);
```

As a convenience, Triplit also provides a method [fetchOne](/client/fetch-one) to fetch just the first entity of a query result.
