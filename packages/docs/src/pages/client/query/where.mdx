# where

To filter results based on conditions, you can use the `where` method. This method accepts a list of clauses as arguments. A clause is a tuple that takes the form `[attribute, operator, value]`.

For example the following query will return all registered users.

```typescript
const query = client
  .query('users')
  .select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob'])
  .where('is_registered', '=', true);
```

Clauses can be passed to `where` as a single clause or an array of clauses:

- `.where('is_registered', '=', true)`
- `.where(['is_registered', '=', true])`
- `.where([['is_registered', '=', true]])`

If multiple clauses are provided, all clauses are joined with a logical AND. However, you may use `or` and `and` methods within the clause array to specify how clauses should be logically grouped and joined.

For example the following query will return all registered users who are either an admin or an owner.

```typescript
import { or } from '@triplit/client';

const query = client
  .query('users')
  .select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob'])
  .where([
    [
      ['is_registered', '=', true],
      or([
        ['role', '=', 'admin'],
        ['role', '=', 'owner'],
      ]),
    ],
  ]);
```

You may use dot notation to filter by attributes of a record.

```typescript
const query = client.query('users').where('address.city', '=', 'New York');
```

### Operators

See the list of [data types](/schemas/types) for more information on the operators that can be used in a where clause.
