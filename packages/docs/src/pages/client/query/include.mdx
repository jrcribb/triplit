# include

If you have defined a [relation in your schema](/schemas/relations) using `RelationById`, `RelationOne`, or `RelationMany`, you can include those related entities in a query.

For example, the following schema defines a relation between `users` and `messages`

```typescript
const schema = {
  users: S.Schema({
    id: S.Id(),
    name: S.Id(),
    email: S.String(),
  }),
  messages: S.Schema({
    id: S.Id(),
    text: S.String(),
    sender_id: S.String(),
    sender: S.RelationById('users', '$sender_id'),
  }),
};
```

By default, a query on `messages` will not include the `sender` as an attribute. To include the sender, use the `include` method in the query builder.

```typescript
const query = client.query('messages').include('sender');

/*
{
  id: '1',
  text: 'hello world!',
  sender_id: 'bob',
  sender: { id: 'bob', name: 'Bob Jones', email: 'bob@triplit.com' },
};
*/
```

## Including multiple relations

If a collection has multiple relations, you can select them by chaining multiple `include` calls.

```typescript
const query = client.query('messages').include('sender').include('receiver');
```
