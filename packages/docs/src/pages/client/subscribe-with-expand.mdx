# subscribeWithExpand

`subscribeWithExpand` is a special type of subscription that is used to fetch a window of data that can programmatically grow in size. It is similar to `subscribe` but it has a few differences:

- It expects the query to have an initial `limit` defined.
- It returns a `loadMore(pageSize?: number)` function to fetch more data. By default, it fetches the next page of data based on the initial `limit` defined in the query.

```typescript
const { unsubscribe, loadMore } = client.subscribeWithExpand(
  query,
  (results, info) => {
    // handle results
  },
  (error) => {
    // handle error
  },
  // Optional
  {
    localOnly: false,
    onRemoteFulfilled: () => {
      console.log('server has sent back results for the subscription');
    },
  }
);
```
