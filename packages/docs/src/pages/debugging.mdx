# Debugging

## Logging

Triplit uses a configurable logger to log information about the client and underlying database's state, as well as the results of fetches and mutations. By default the logger is set to `'info'` level, but supports `'warn' | 'error' | 'debug'` as well.

You can set the logger level by passing a `logLevel` option to the `TriplitClient` constructor:

```ts
import { TriplitClient } from '@triplit/client';

const client = new TriplitClient({
  logLevel: 'debug',
});
```

If you'd like to save and export logs, you must set the `logLevel` to `'debug'`. You can then access the logs and relevant metadata from the `TriplitClient` instance:

```ts
const logs = client.logs; // an array of log objects

// copy the logs to the clipboard when in the browser
copy(JSON.stringify(logs));

// or save the logs to a file when in Node.js
import fs from 'fs';
fs.writeFileSync('logs.json', JSON.stringify(logs));
```

## Inspecting a client in the browser

The `TriplitClient` class can be accessed from your browser console by adding the following code to an application that uses the `TriplitClient`:

```ts copy filename="App.tsx"
const client = new TriplitClient();

if (typeof window !== 'undefined') window.client = client;
```

This will make the `client` object available in the browser console, allowing you to inspect the state of the client and call methods on it, e.g. with `client.fetch`.
