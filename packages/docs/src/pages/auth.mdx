# Authentication and Authorization

## Authentication

Many apps require a way to authenticate users. Triplit is configured to look for certain [variables](/fetching-data/queries#variables) to determine who is making a request. This information is then used to inform the [authorization](#authorization) process.

Authentication itself should be handled by an authentication service outside of Triplit. This could be a third-party service like [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth), [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/auth), etc or a custom service built by your team. The authentication service should provide a way to generate a token with Triplit specific claims that can be used to identify the user.

A token must have the following claims:

- `x-triplit-user-id`: The user's unique identifier
- `x-triplit-project-id`: The project's unique identifier

With these claims, Triplit can assign the special variable `$SESSION_USER_ID` in its queries, which can be used to filter data based on the user making the request.

## Authorization

Triplit allows you to define rules on your collections that determine who can read and write data. These rules are defined in the `rules` property of your collection's schema.

Rules are defined as [filter clauses](/fetching-data/queries#filtering) that are applied to a query's result. For example, a write rule `[['author', '=', '$SESSION_USER_ID']]` on a collection `todos` would only allow users to assign themselves as the author of a todo.

Rules can be defined in your [schema](/access-control) or in your project's [Dashboard](https://www.triplit.dev/dashboard) (coming soon).
