# Authentication and Authorization

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. This usually involves a user providing some form of credentials (like a username and password) to a service, which then validates those credentials and provides a way to identify the user in future requests. This identity can be used to determine what data the user has access to ([authorization](/schemas/permissions)).

## Authentication

Triplit uses [JWTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) to communicate user identity. Authentication (that is the validation that a user is who they say they are, and the generation of a JWT identifying the user) itself should be handled by an authentication service outside of Triplit. This could be a third-party service like [Clerk](https://clerk.com/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth), [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/auth), etc or a custom service built by your team.

The JWT will need to be signed with a proper signature. Triplit supports both symmetric (HS256) and asymmetric (RS256) encryption algorithms for JWTs. If you are using Triplit's hosted offering [Triplit Cloud](/triplit-cloud), then you will need to provide the JWT's signing secret or public key to Triplit in the `External JWT secret` field in your project's settings. If you are self-hosting Triplit, you will need to provide the signing secret or public key when you start the server with the `EXTERNAL_JWT_SECRET` environmental variable.

The JWT should usually have some user-identifying information (e.g. the [`sub` claim](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2)), which can be accessed by Triplit to handle [access control](/schemas/permissions) that user. For backwards compatibility, Triplit reads the following claims:

- `x-triplit-user-id`: The user's unique identifier. This is assigned to the variable `$session.SESSION_USER_ID` in queries.

### Tokens

Triplit provides two basic tokens that are available in your project [dashboard](https://www.triplit.dev/dashboard):

- `anon` token: A token that represents an anonymous user. This token is safe to use on a client side device and should be used when no user is logged in.
- `service` token: This token is used for administrative purposes and should only be used in trusted environments like a server you control. This token will bypass all access control checks.

When getting started with Triplit these are fine to use, but they don't specify which application user is accessing the database, or if they have a distinct access role. This information can be configured by providing a JWT with the proper claims and signature (see previous section). Triplit's flexible design allows you to define any JWT claims you would like.

### Using your tokens

When you instantiate a `TriplitClient`, you can provide an initial token to authenticate with the server. This token is used to determine what data the client has access to.

```typescript
import { TriplitClient } from '@triplit/client';
const client = new TriplitClient({
  token: '<your-token>',
  serverUrl: 'https://<project-id>.triplit.io',
});
```

This will automically connect the client to the server and authenticate with the provided token. If you would like to connect manually, you can set `autoConnect` to `false` and call `client.connect()` when ready.

```typescript {5, 10}
import { TriplitClient } from '@triplit/client';
const client = new TriplitClient({
  token: '<your-token>',
  serverUrl: 'https://<project-id>.triplit.io',
  autoConnect: false,
});

// Do other things

client.connect();
```

### Changing users

It is common for an app to need to change the user that is currently authenticated. This could be because a user is signing out, or because a user is signing in. You generally want to follow these steps when changing users:

1. Disconnect the client
1. Update the token
1. Perform any necessary cleanup
1. Reconnect the client

When signing out a user, it is recommeded to call the `reset` method on your client. This will ensure any data that is stored from another user's session is cleared and any state related to syncing is reset.

```typescript
async function onSignOut() {
  client.disconnect();
  client.updateToken(undefined);
  await client.reset();
}

function onSignIn(newToken: string) {
  client.updateToken(newToken);
  client.connect();
}
```

More information on updating client options can be found in the [client documentation](client/options#auth-options).

## Authorization

Triplit allows you to define rules on your collections that determine who can read and write data. This is usually based on the tokens you provide. See [permissions](/schemas/permissions) for more information on reading your tokens in queries and access control definitions.
