# Using Supabase Auth with Triplit

[Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth) is one of the services in the Supabase ecosystem that makes it easy to manage user accounts and authentication in your application. This guide will show you how to set up Supabase Auth with Triplit.

<Callout>
  This guide assumes you have a Triplit project set up. If you don't have one,
  you can create one by following the [Quick Start](/quick-start) guide.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create a Supabase account and project

Use the [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) to create an account and a project. This will setup a Postgres database and a Supabase Auth instance for your project.

### Get the JWT Secret for your Supabase project

We also need to configure Triplit to validate the JWT tokens issued by Supabase. To do this, we need the JWT signing secret for your Supabase project. You can find this in the **JWT Settings** panel section of the **API Settings** panel.

![Supabase API Settings](/supabase-auth-guide/api-settings.png)

For local dev, add this to your `.env` file in your Triplit app:

```env copy
TRIPLIT_EXTERNAL_JWT_SECRET=<supabase-jwt-secret>
```

### Start the Triplit development server

Now that we've configured Supabase and added the necessary environmental variables, we can start the Triplit development server:

```bash
npx triplit dev
```

### Add Supabase Auth to your Triplit app

Your app should have some flow to [authenticate a user](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithpassword) that uses Supabase's authentication methods. Once a user is signed in, your Triplit client needs to send the JWT token issued by Supabase with each request. You can do this with the `TriplitClient.updateToken` method.

```ts copy
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import { TriplitClient } from '@triplit/client';
import { schema } from './schema';

const supabase = createClient(
  'https://<project>.supabase.co',
  '<your-anon-key>'
);

const triplit = new TriplitClient({
  schema,
  serverUrl: 'http://localhost:6543',
});

async function updateTriplitWithAuthSession(session) {
  const newToken = session?.access_token;
  // if the token has changed, update the client
  if (newToken !== triplit.token) {
    triplit.disconnect();
    triplit.updateToken(newToken);
    if (!triplit.token) {
      // If no token, we are unauthenticated, reset the client in case there is any data for the previous session stored
      await triplit.reset();
    } else {
      // If we have a token, connect to the server with new information
      triplit.connect();
    }
  }
}

// Get initial session data on page load and subscribe to changes
function getSessionAndSubscribe() {
  supabase.auth.getSession().then(async ({ data: { session } }) => {
    await updateTriplitWithAuthSession(session);
  });
  const { data: session } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(
    async (_event, session) => {
      await updateTriplitWithAuthSession(session);
    }
  );
  return session.subscription.unsubscribe;
}
```

Generally you'll want to run `getSessionAndSubscribe()` when your app loads and then unsubscribe from the session changes when your app unmounts.

```ts copy
// on mount
const unsubscribe = getSessionAndSubscribe();

// on unmount
unsubscribe();
```

### Test locally

Run you Triplit app and sign in with Supabase Auth. If youâ€™re setup correctly, you should see the connection is established and your data is syncing with your server. If you can't connect, ensure that you set the `TRIPLIT_EXTERNAL_JWT_SECRET` environmental variables correctly.

### Configure your Triplit dashboard

To use Supabase Auth with a deployed Triplit server, you just need ensure that it can use the Supabase JWT Secret to verify incoming requests.

If you're using the Triplit Dashboard, you can add the JWT Secret to the **External JWT secret** input in your project settings.

![Triplit Project Settings](/dashboard-screenshots/authentication.png)

If you're using a custom self-hosted server, you need to set the `EXTERNAL_JWT_SECRET` environmental variable to the public key.

### Add access control to your schema

Now that you have a user auth system set up, you can add roles and permissions to your Triplit schema. By default, the JWT issued by Supabase will set the `sub` claim to the authenticated user's unique identifier. It will also have the `role: 'authenticated'` claim. In Triplit, you can write a matcher object that will set up a simple `user` role:

```ts copy
import { Roles } from '@triplit/client';

export const roles: Roles = {
  user: {
    match: {
      sub: '$userId',
      role: 'authenticated',
    },
  },
};
```

[Read here to see how you can use this Role to define a permission.](/docs/schemas/permissions).
