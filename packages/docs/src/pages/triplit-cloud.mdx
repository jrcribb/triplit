Triplit Cloud is a fully managed service that allows you to manage your Triplit projects without having to worry about the infrastructure. It is a great way to start scaling with Triplit and is suitable for most use cases.

## Getting Started

Visit the [Triplit Dashboard](https://triplit.dev/dashboard) to view your projects and create new ones.

### Creating a Project

- Click the **Create Project** button
- Provide a name for your project. This will act as a friendly alias for your project throughout the dashboard.
- Once you have created a project, you will be taken to the project page. Here you can view your project's API tokens and manage your project's environments.

### Managing a Project

Your project page will contain the details of your project, including the database host and API tokens you can use to [sync](/syncing-data) with your remote database from your Triplit Client.

### Data management

You can manage your project's data by clicking the **Open Console** button on your project page. This will take you to the Triplit Console, where you can view and edit your project's collections, entities, and schema.
