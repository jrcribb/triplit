# Relations

To define a relationship between two collections, you define a subquery that describes the relationship with `RelationMany`, `RelationOne` or `RelationById`. while `RelationOne` and `RelationById` are designed for singleton relations and will be directly nested or a sub-object or `null` if an applicable entity doesn't exist. Within a relation, either in a where clause or the `RelationById` id, parameter, you can reference the current collection's attributes with `$`.

## RelationMany

A `RelationMany` attribute will be in the shape `Map<string, Entity>`. It's designed to model a one-to-many relationship between two collections. The `RelationMany` attribute will be a map of the related entities keyed by their id. If no related entities are found, the attribute will be an empty map.

In this example schema, we are modeling a school, where departments have many classes. The `departments` collection has a `classes` attribute that is a `RelationMany` to the `classes` collection.

```typescript {8-10}
import { Schema as S } from '@triplit/client';

const schema = {
  departments: {
    schema: S.Schema({
      id: S.Id(),
      name: S.String(),
      classes: S.RelationMany('classes', {
        where: [['department_id', '=', '$id']],
      }),
    }),
  },
  classes: {
    schema: S.Schema({
      id: S.Id(),
      name: S.String(),
      level: S.Number(),
      building: S.String(),
      department_id: S.String(),
    }),
  },
};
```

## RelationOne

A `RelationOne` attribute will be an `Entity` or `null`. It's designed to model a one-to-one relationship between two collections. The `RelationOne` attribute will be the related entity or `null` if no related entity is found.

We can update our model of a school, so that a class has a relation to its department.

```typescript {20-22}
import { Schema as S } from '@triplit/client';

const schema = {
  departments: {
    schema: S.Schema({
      id: S.Id(),
      name: S.String(),
      classes: S.RelationMany('classes', {
        where: [['department_id', '=', '$id']],
      }),
    }),
  },
  classes: {
    schema: S.Schema({
      id: S.Id(),
      name: S.String(),
      level: S.Number(),
      building: S.String(),
      department_id: S.String(),
      department: S.RelationOne('departments', {
        where: [['id', '=', '$department_id']],
      }),
    }),
  },
};
```

## RelationById

RelationById is a special case of `RelationOne` that is used to define a relationship by a foreign key. The `RelationById` attribute will be the related entity or `null` if no related entity is found.

We can update the previous example to use `RelationById` instead of `RelationOne`.

```typescript {20}
import { Schema as S } from '@triplit/client';

const schema = {
  departments: {
    schema: S.Schema({
      id: S.Id(),
      name: S.String(),
      classes: S.RelationMany('classes', {
        where: [['department_id', '=', '$id']],
      }),
    }),
  },
  classes: {
    schema: S.Schema({
      id: S.Id(),
      name: S.String(),
      level: S.Number(),
      building: S.String(),
      department_id: S.String(),
      department: S.RelationById('departments', '$department_id'),
    }),
  },
};
```

## Querying collections with relations

By default, queries on collections with relations will _not_ return related data. You can use the `include` method to specify which relations you want to include in the query.

```typescript
const classesQuery = client.query('classes').include('department');
const departmentsQuery = client.query('departments').include('classes');
```

## Defining relations with referential variables
