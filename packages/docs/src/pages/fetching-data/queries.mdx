# Queries

## Defining queries

Data in Triplit is organized into collections, so to define a query you must first specify which collection you want to query.

For example, if you want to query the `users` collection, you would write the following:

```typescript
const query = client.query('users');
```

## Selecting attributes

To specify which attributes you want to return, you can use the `select` method. This method accepts a list of attribute names for the collection as arguments.

```typescript
const query = client.query('users').select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob']);
```

If the type you are selecting is a record, you may also select a specific attribute of the record by using dot notation. The result will be an object with just the selected keys.

```typescript
const query = client
  .query('users')
  .select(['id', 'address.street', 'address.city']);
// {id: 'abc', address: {street: '123 Main St', city: 'New York'}}
```

If you do not call select on a query, all attributes are selected.

### Selecting related entities

If you have defined a relation in your schema using `RelationById`, `RelationOne`, or `RelationMany`, you can choose to select entities defined by the relation in a query.

For example, the following schema defines a relation between `users` and `messages`

```typescript
const schema = {
  users: S.Schema({
    id: S.Id(),
    name: S.Id(),
    email: S.String(),
  }),
  messages: S.Schema({
    id: S.Id(),
    text: S.String(),
    sender_id: S.String(),
    sender: S.RelationById('users', '$sender_id'),
  }),
};
```

By default, a query on `messages` will not include the `sender` as an attribute. To include the sender, use the `include` method in the query builder.

```typescript
const query = client.query('messages').include('sender');

/*
{
  id: '1',
  text: 'hello world!',
  sender_id: 'bob',
  sender: new Map([
    ['bob', { id: 'bob', name: 'Bob Jones', email: 'bob@triplit.com' }],
  ]),
};
*/
```

## Filtering

To filter results based on conditions, you can use the `where` method. This method accepts a list of clauses as arguments. A clause is a tuple that takes the form `[attribute, operator, value]`.

For example the following query will return all registered users.

```typescript
const query = client
  .query('users')
  .select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob'])
  .where('is_registered', '=', true);
```

Clauses can be passed to `where` as a single clause or an array of clauses:

- `.where('is_registered', '=', true)`
- `.where(['is_registered', '=', true])`
- `.where([['is_registered', '=', true]])`

If multiple clauses are provided, all clauses are joined with a logical AND. However, you may use `or` and `and` methods within the clause array to specify how clauses should be logically grouped and joined.

For example the following query will return all registered users who are either an admin or an owner.

```typescript
import { or } from '@triplit/client';

const query = client
  .query('users')
  .select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob'])
  .where([
    [
      ['is_registered', '=', true],
      or([
        ['role', '=', 'admin'],
        ['role', '=', 'owner'],
      ]),
    ],
  ]);
```

You may use dot notation to filter by attributes of a record.

```typescript
const query = client.query('users').where('address.city', '=', 'New York');
```

### Operators

See the list of [data types](/schemas#data-types) for more information on the operators that can be used in a where clause.

## Order

To order the results of a query, you can use the `order` method. This method accepts a list of order clauses as an argument. An order clause is a tuple that takes the form `[attribute, direction]`. `direction` can be either `ASC` or `DESC`. Clauses are applied in the order they are provided.

For example the following query will return all users ordered by their creation date in descending order.

```typescript
const query = client
  .query('users')
  .select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob'])
  .order('created_at', 'DESC');
```

Clauses can be passed to `order` as a single clause or an array of clauses:

- `.order('created_at', 'DESC')`
- `.order(['created_at', 'DESC'])`
- `.order([['created_at', 'DESC']])`

You may use dot notation to order by attributes of a record.

```typescript
const query = client.query('users').order('address.city', 'ASC');
```

### After

You may use the `after` method to specify an entity to start the query from. This is useful for paginating results. You must use `order` before using `after`. At the moment, `after` only supports a single cursor that corresponds to the first `order` clause.

```typescript {12-14}
const PAGE_SIZE = 10;

const query = client
  .query('users')
  .select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob'])
  .order('created_at', 'DESC')
  .limit(PAGE_SIZE);

const { results: firstPage } = client.fetch(query);
const lastEntity = Array.from(firstPage.values()).pop();

const secondPageQuery = query.after(lastEntity);
const { results: secondPage } = client.fetch(secondPageQuery);
```

## Limit

Many times you will want to limit the number of results returned by a query. To do this, you can use the `limit` method.

For example, the following query will return the 10 most recently created users.

```typescript
const query = client
  .query('users')
  .select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob'])
  .order('created_at', 'DESC')
  .limit(10);
```

As a convenience, Triplit also provides a method [fetchOne](/fetching-data/fetch#fetchone) to fetch just the first entity of a query result.

## Variables

You may pass variables to a query by using the `variables` method. Variables are passed in as strings with `$` prepended to the variable name.

For example, you may define a query that queries for restaurants that are open by cuisine:

```typescript
const baseQuery = client.query('restaurants').where([
  ['is_open', '=', true],
  ['cuisine', '=', '$cuisine'],
]);
const openItalianRestaurantsQuery = baseQuery.variables({ cuisine: 'italian' });
const openMexicanRestaurantsQuery = baseQuery.variables({ cuisine: 'mexican' });
```

This can help prevent writing the same query multiple times with different values.

Certain variables are used internally by Triplit to aid with authorization and other features. These include:

- `$SESSION_USER_ID`

## Sync state

Triplit's client [storage](/client-database/storage) is split into two areas - an outbox for unsynced updates and a cache for synced updates. Sometimes you may want to indicate that to a user that data has not yet been saved to the server. To do this, you can use the `syncStatus` method. This method accepts a single sync state (`pending`, `confirmed`, `all`) as an argument.

For example, a messaging app could use two queries to build message sent indicators. In [React](/frameworks/react):

```tsx
const allMessagesQuery = client.query('messages').order(['createdAt', 'ASC']);

const pendingMessagesQuery = client
  .query('messages')
  .select(['id'])
  .syncStatus('pending');

function Messages() {
  const { results: allMessages } = useQuery(client, allMessagesQuery);
  const { results: pendingMessages } = useQuery(client, pendingMessagesQuery);

  return (
    <div>
      {allMessages.entries().map(([id, message]) => (
        <div>
          <p>{message.text}</p>
          <p>{pendingMessages.has(id) ? 'Sending...' : 'Sent'}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Entity id

Setting `entityId` on your query will return exclusively the requested entity if it exists.

For example, the following query will return just the user with id `abc`, if it exists.

```typescript
const query = client.query('users').entityId('abc');
```

You may also pass a DB variable to `entityId`.

```typescript
const query = client.query('users').entityId('$userId');
```

As a convenience, Triplit also provides a method [fetchById](/fetching-data/fetch#fetchbyid) to fetch an entity by its id.
